# Voice Guide

Detailed voice mechanics, lexicon, and example patterns for writing tweets in Keanan's voice.

## Emotional Mechanics

These techniques create the specific emotional responses in readers:

### Ellipses After Setup
- Creates suspense/anticipation
- Place "…" before the reveal
- Example: "Tried the new Claude feature..." → reveal

### Contrast Pairs (Before/After)
- Provides clarity + momentum
- Label each side with concrete details
- Example: "Old way: 3 manual steps. New way: one command."

### Self-Deprecating Aside
- Creates warmth + relatability
- Admit limits lightly, often with a grin emoji
- Example: "Still debugging that edge case 😅"

### Rhetorical Question
- Drives engagement
- Pose a practical "what now?" then answer it
- Example: "What's the fastest way to X? Turns out..."

### Imperative Nudge
- Gives reader agency
- Issue a simple, testable instruction
- Example: "Try running `npm start` with the --verbose flag."

### Emoji as Punctuation
- Creates emotional spike
- Place after a revelation, not mid-clause
- Example: "It compiled on the first try 🎉"

## Lexicon

### Avoid → Prefer

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| Abstract "do stuff" | Concrete "clone, install, run" |
| Heavy certainty | Light hedges with a plan |
| Jargon walls | Named tools and files |
| Generic praise | Specific outcomes ("boots locally," "compiles clean") |

### Signature Vocabulary

**Friction/flow words:** edges, bloopers, spin-up, spiral, clean run

**Micro-wins:** tiny win, quick spin, first try energy

**Outcome anchors:** locally, end-to-end, on-device, in browser

## Example Patterns

These patterns are for emotional effect reference. Never copy phrasing directly—use them to understand the structure.

### Discovery Pattern

Structure:
1. Setup with curiosity hook
2. Minimal context (tool + goal)
3. Reveal with emoji punctuation
4. Light caveat
5. Optional CTA

Example structure (don't copy words):
```
Tried [thing]...

Just wanted to [simple goal]. Used [tool].

Actually worked on the first run 🎉

Fair warning: [edge case]. But for most use cases, try [specific action].
```

### Contrast Pattern

Structure:
1. Old way = friction (concrete pain)
2. New way = flow (specific solution)
3. Proof point (time saved, outcome)
4. Button emoji

Example structure (don't copy words):
```
Old workflow: [tedious multi-step process with specifics]

New workflow: [simple solution with named tool]

Saved [time/effort]. Works for [use case] ⚡
```

## Voice Anti-Patterns

Things to avoid:

- **Corporate jargon:** "leverage," "synergy," "utilize"
- **Over-hedging stacks:** "I think maybe it might possibly work"
- **Passive voice clusters:** "The feature was tested and was found to be..."
- **Emoji chains:** "🔥🔥🔥💯💯"
- **Vague praise:** "This is amazing!" (say WHY it's useful)
- **No specifics:** Always name the tool, file, or outcome
