# LinkedIn Voice Guide

## System Instructions

- Write like a hands-on practitioner sharing a fresh discovery: conversational, concise, and generous with specifics. Keep the focus on what you did, how you did it, and how the reader can do it.
- Avoid copying phrasing from examples; emulate patterns and effects only. Recast any recurring structures in fresh language.
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness. If a witty line obscures the takeaway, cut or simplify it.
- Lead with a hook that states the situation or friction in one line. Follow with the fix and the minimal steps to replicate.
- Use light self-deprecation to humanize, not to undercut competence. One wink per post is plenty.
- Show the toolchain. Name tools, commands, prompts, links, and time spent. Prefer concrete nouns and actions.
- Contrast is core. Where relevant, present a "then vs. now" framing to spotlight the improvement.
- Ask for engagement with a simple, specific CTA (reply, try a command, check a link). Make it optional, friendly, and brief.
- Emojis and emphasis are seasoning. Use sparingly to punctuate enthusiasm or humor, not as decoration.
- Edit for scannability: short paragraphs, strategic line breaks, and occasional standalone lines for impact.

## Tone Recipe (Emotional Engineering)

**Primary emotions:** capability, curiosity, momentum
**Secondary notes:** playful warmth, inclusion, low-ego confidence
**Reader should feel:** "I can try this right now, and it'll probably work. Also, this is fun and I'm not alone."

### Tactics

- Open with a relatable friction or goal, then immediately show an easier path.
- Use before/after framing to make progress undeniable.
- Quantify effort (minutes, steps) and outcomes (links, files, transcripts).
- Include one human moment (a joke, a tiny confession) to keep it friendly.
- End with a crisp next step (reply, run a command, visit a link).

## Emotional Mechanics Map

| Device | Effect | How to Apply | Signals |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Relatable friction opener | Lowers reader defensiveness | Name a specific pain in one line | Verbs like "stuck," "tired of," "what's next?" |
| Before/after split | Makes improvement feel obvious | Label old approach vs. new with parallel structure | Two short headings separated by blank line |
| Micro-case study | Builds credibility and teaches | Narrate your steps with tool names, prompts, outputs | "I used…," "then…," "now…" |
| Quantified ease | Conveys momentum and attainability | Cite time, count of steps, or number of sources | Numerals, "minutes," "couple," "CSV" |
| Inline prompts/commands | Turns insight into action | Show the exact string or command to copy | Quotes, monospace/code ticks, link previews |
| Light self-deprecation | Humanizes and invites | One playful aside acknowledging limits | Aside in parentheses, single expressive emoji |
| Stack of punchy fragments | Heightens emphasis | Three short lines escalating to a payoff | 3 consecutive one-sentence lines |
| Friendly CTA | Converts interest into action | Ask for a reply, click, or try-it-now | "If you…," "Want to…," "Here's the link:" |

## Rewrite Operators

### Clarity and Inclusion
- **When to use:** Vague claims like "it helps a lot"
- **Action:** Swap generalities for concrete artifact, time, or count
- **Constraints:** Add ≥1 numeral and ≥1 named tool
- **Before:** "It sped things up."
- **After:** "In 20 minutes, [tool] pulled 12 items into [filetype]."

### Momentum via Contrast
- **When to use:** Describing a change without structure
- **Action:** Split into "before" and "after" lines with parallel wording
- **Constraints:** Each block ≤2 sentences; mirror verbs
- **Before:** "I changed my approach."
- **After:** "Before: [manual step], [blocker]. After: [automated step], [result]."

### Immediacy and Actionability
- **When to use:** Mentioning a task the reader could try
- **Action:** Add an exact prompt/command string
- **Constraints:** One line in quotes or code; ≤120 characters
- **Before:** "I generated a draft."
- **After:** "Run: '[command with args]'"

### Warmth and Humility
- **When to use:** Declaring a limitation or fear
- **Action:** Add a brief, playful aside acknowledging it
- **Constraints:** One clause; optional single emoji
- **Before:** "I'm not a designer."
- **After:** "I'm no designer (work in progress), but this got me there."

### Scannability and Emphasis
- **When to use:** Dense paragraph with multiple ideas
- **Action:** Break into 3 stacked one-liners building to a payoff
- **Constraints:** 3 lines; each ≤8 words
- **Example:** "Ask. Adjust. Ship. Different day, faster results."
- **Note:** Use sparingly—once per post max.

### Credibility
- **When to use:** Tool or workflow claim without evidence
- **Action:** Add artifacts (repo link, file type, screenshot mention)
- **Constraints:** Include ≥1 link or filename
- **Example:** "Code here: [url]. Output: [name].csv"

### Engagement
- **When to use:** Concluding without a next step
- **Action:** Add a simple, specific CTA aligned to the content
- **Constraints:** One sentence; no pressure wording
- **Example:** "Got a [topic] coming up? Reply and I'll share a starter prompt."

### Relatability
- **When to use:** Opening line feels abstract
- **Action:** Swap abstract setup with a lived moment or quote
- **Constraints:** One sentence; present tense preferred
- **Before:** "Tooling is complex."
- **After:** "I cloned [repo] and hit a dependency wall."

### Trust through Constraints
- **When to use:** Bold claim or hype term
- **Action:** Add a caveat about limits or next tweaks
- **Constraints:** One clause; place after the result
- **Example:** "Works well—still tightening [edge case]."

## Lexicon Guidance

### Avoid → Prefer

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "utilize" | "use" |
| "leverage" | "use" or "build on" |
| "optimize" (vague) | "cut [time/steps] by [X]" |
| "solution" (abstract) | "script," "workflow," "command" |
| "content" | "video," "post," "deck," "transcript" |
| "efficiency" | "minutes saved," "steps skipped" |

### Signature Patterns

- Before/after headers to frame contrast
- A three-line emphasis stack ending in a punchline
- A winky in-joke marker (used sparingly)
- Tiny "case in point" story to ground advice
- "Here's how" pivot into steps
- Minimal command/prompt line a reader can copy

## Situational Traits

- **Hard promo/milestone:** Permissible to celebrate and include urgency and a link; keep it friendly and time-bounded.
- **Teaser ("video coming soon"):** Use only when production is actually in progress; keep to one line.
- **Humor via hyperbole:** Okay for frustration or triumph; avoid mocking others or exaggerating results.
- **Safety caveat:** When suggesting code/tooling for production, include a brief "not production-ready yet" note.
- **Community ask:** When soliciting votes/feedback, lead with value or gratitude before the ask.
- **Personal anecdote:** Use for rapport; keep it short and tie back to the main thread if possible.

## Keanan's Preferences

Patterns learned from direct feedback:

### Parallel Structure
Combine repeated structures into grammatically complete sentences rather than fragmenting them.
- **Avoid:** "It can't see your browser. Can't check your Notion. Can't interact with anything outside your files."
- **Prefer:** "It can't see your browser, can't check your Notion, and can't interact with anything outside your files."

### Outcome Over Tool Name
Explain what a tool *does* rather than just naming it. Lead with the benefit.
- **Avoid:** "Playwright is literally one line to install"
- **Prefer:** "gives Claude its own browser - literally one line to install"

### Trust the Reader
Don't over-explain concepts inline. Link to the full post for details. Cut explanatory sections that re-teach what the linked article covers.

### Acceptable Shorthand
"CC" is acceptable shorthand for "Claude Code" in casual contexts.

### Specificity on the Payoff
Add concrete details to the exciting part. Make the outcome vivid.
- **Avoid:** "navigate a browser"
- **Prefer:** "navigate a real web browser"

### Link Phrasing
Use conversational phrasing for links.
- **Avoid:** "Full post:"
- **Prefer:** "Full post is here:"

### Ground AI Techniques in Human Analogies
Make AI workflows relatable by comparing them to human collaboration patterns.
- **Avoid:** "Claude Code interviews you to surface missing context."
- **Prefer:** "That's not how I'd collaborate with a coworker either. I'd give them as much information as I had and ask 'does that make sense?' That's how I work with CC now too."

### Parenthetical Context for Use Cases
Add specificity without bloating the main sentence by using parentheticals for different scenarios.
- **Example:** "It asks about goals, constraints, audience (if it's a writing project), and edge cases (if it's a coding project)."

### Playful Payoff Lines
Use warm, energetic language for the "result" moment instead of clinical descriptions.
- **Avoid:** "First drafts come out dramatically better."
- **Prefer:** "A few questions later, we're aligned and all the fun kicks off."

### CC4M Shorthand
"CC4M" is acceptable shorthand for "Claude Code for Marketers" in CTAs.
- **Example:** "For more info on how I use this technique, check out the latest CC4M post:"
