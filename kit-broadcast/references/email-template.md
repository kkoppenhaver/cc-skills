## One-sentence description

Be specific about what the post actually covers. Avoid vague, generic descriptions.

**Bad (too vague):** "Today's post is about small things that make a big difference once you know about them."

**Good (specific):** "Today's post is about some tricks of Claude Code that can make a big difference once you start using them in your workflow."

The reader should know what they'll learn from this sentence alone.
