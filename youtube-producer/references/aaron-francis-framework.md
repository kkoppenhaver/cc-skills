# Aaron Francis Framework

## Core Philosophy
**The "Nugget + Packaging" Framework** (formerly "Peanut Butter and Pill")

Every video has two essential components:
- **The Educational Nugget**: The technical concept you want to teach (the "pill")
- **The Packaging**: The wrapper that makes it clickable and relatable (the "peanut butter")

*"It's like feeding a dog a pill. You cover it in peanut butter, and then you're like, 'Hey. Do you want some peanut butter?' And they eat it."*

**Critical distinction from clickbait**: The packaging must be *accurate* to what's delivered. Misleading viewers crosses ethical boundaries and destroys trust.

## The 30-Second Hook Rule

**"The opening talking head has gotta be quick—30 seconds or less. Otherwise, people're gonna click away."**

### Three Opening Patterns

1. **Problem-First Framing**
   - Surface a problem viewers didn't know they had
   - Example: Gmail plus-sign trick exploiting free accounts
   - Establish stakes before mentioning technical solution

2. **Contrarian Claim**
   - Challenge assumed best practices
   - Engages both defenders and skeptics
   - Creates tension that only resolution satisfies

3. **Identity Appeal**
   - "If you're a SaaS operator..."
   - "As an application developer..."
   - Target the "meaty middle" - developers who aren't DBAs but need database knowledge

## Title Formulas That Convert

### Examples of Nugget → Packaging Transformation

| Educational Nugget | Aaron's Actual Title | Views |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Virtual generated columns in MySQL | "Using MySQL to stop freeloaders (in only 8 minutes)" | 37.1k |
| PHP language improvements 2012-2023 | "PHP doesn't suck (anymore)" | 221.1k |
| Proper row counting in SQL | "Stop using COUNT(id) to count rows" | 379.8k |
| Database column size optimization | "INT(11) is a lie" | 19.5k |
| JSON columns in MySQL | "You don't need NoSQL (use MySQL)" | 79.3k |

### The Contrarian Command Formula
**Pattern**: "Stop using X" / "You don't need X" / "Don't do X"

Why it works: Challenges assumed best practices, creates immediate curiosity about what convention is wrong.

### The Parenthetical Qualifier
Aaron's signature technique for being bold without being dishonest:
- "PHP doesn't suck **(anymore)**" - acknowledges it *did* suck
- "React Server Components are a bad choice **(for shipping)**" - limits scope
- "Your database will break in 2038 **(or sooner)**" - adds specificity

The parenthetical signals intellectual honesty while maintaining hook power.

### Permission-Giving Titles
- "You don't always need JOINs" (123.1k views)
- Liberates developers from complexity they dreaded
- Telling someone they *don't* have to do something difficult is inherently appealing

## The Chunk Method for Retention

Structure videos in discrete 2-3 minute segments with deliberate visual switching:

1. **Opening talking head** - 30 seconds max, no cuts ideally
2. **Screen recording chunk** - 2-3 minutes of coding with face cam
3. **Interstitial talking head** - return to full-screen, summarize, preview
4. **Repeat** - creates natural engagement points

*"If you were to stay on your code editor and your face cam bubble for 6 or 7 minutes, people are gonna get a little bit bored. Even if the content is good, you kinda wanna switch up some visuals every now and then to keep that little dopamine pumping."*

## Recording Process

### Bullet Points Over Scripts
*"What I find is a full-on script feels a little bit stifling to me. It puts me in robot-reading-a-script zone."*

Instead: **Waypoint method**
- Know the signposts
- Jazz between them
- Find funny turns of phrase naturally

### The Transcription Hack
1. Turn on microphone
2. Open Google Doc with transcribe
3. Pretend to give the video
4. Get bad takes out of system
5. Use transcription as bullet points

### Immediate Rough Cuts
*"Do the rough cut immediately after you finish recording because it's still fresh. Maybe 1 out of 10 times, I decide I just really didn't explain that very well."*

## The "Amplified Self" Energy Formula

**Rule 1**: Be yourself
**Rule 2**: Crank it up a notch or 2

*"You're an insane person because you're in your spare bedroom waving your hands and shouting at a camera. That's objectively insane. But if you don't ramp it up, your YouTube videos are gonna come across really downbeat."*

Technical reason: Cameras flatten energy. What feels appropriate in conversation reads as flat on video.

Practical solution: Watch your own previous 2-4 videos before recording to match established energy levels.

## Content Strategy

### The "Correctional Hook"
Identify common habits or "best practices" that are technically suboptimal and challenge viewers to stop. Triggers "fear of incompetence" (FOI).

Examples:
- "Stop using COUNT(id)" - 379k views
- "INT(11) is a lie" - 19.5k views
- "Don't hide your database indexes!" - 13.5k views

### Business Value as Context
Frame technical content through business problems:
- Instead of: "How to use Virtual Generated Columns"
- Use: "Using MySQL to stop freeloaders"

This answers "Why should I care?" before viewers even click.

### Tech Tribalism
PHP content dramatically outperforms because PHP vs. JavaScript debates are emotionally charged:
- "PHP on the frontend! No more Javascript!" - 134.1k views
- "PHP doesn't suck (anymore)" - 221.1k views
- "PHP is the future" - 191.8k views

## The "Try Hard" Philosophy

*"Standing out becomes much easier when you're willing to exert maximum effort."*

### The 1000 Little Things Effect
- Hide desktop icons
- Change background to something pleasing
- Cut down awkward pauses
- Clean terminal setup
- Professional lighting

*"These seem silly, but if you add up 5 silly things, 10 silly things, suddenly you look at a video and think, 'I can't quite put my finger on it, but this is really good.'"*

### Anti-Burnout Principles
- Only make content about topics you're genuinely excited about
- Internal motivation alignment matters more than algorithm optimization
- *"You can still produce videos that do super well that you hate the content of, and you're gonna die. Your insides will be hollowed out."*

## Algorithm Alignment (Without Obsession)

### What Aaron Does:
- Clickable titles and thumbnails (but not "shocked face")
- Fast openings passing 30-second retention test
- Visual variety to maintain watch time
- Consistent publishing on exciting topics

### What Aaron Refuses:
- Pretending surprise about mundane things
- Clickbait thumbnails with exaggerated expressions
- Content he doesn't personally care about
- Cynicism or sarcasm (communicates poorly)
- YouTube-style cuts every 3 seconds

*"I don't let the algorithm tail wag the dog very much. Of course, I want to do what the platform wants so that the platform will promote me. More than that, I want to do what I want to do."*

## Production Style

### Screencasting Excellence
- Multi-camera setups
- High-quality lighting (the "shed" aesthetic)
- Plants and consistent visual branding
- Face always visible (builds trust)
- Clean code editor setup
- Thoughtful syntax highlighting

### The "Internet Nice Guy" Brand
- Consciously cultivates kindness and sincerity
- Makes channel a "safe space" for learning
- Viewers less afraid of "feeling stupid"
- Admits own struggles openly
- Dad to twins (humanizing element)

## Content Ecosystem

### Multi-Platform Strategy
- **YouTube**: Brand building, broad reach
- **Twitter/X**: Testing ground for hooks
- **Mostly Technical Podcast**: Retention through intimacy
- **Screencasting.com**: Teaching others to teach
- **High Performance SQLite**: Course demonstrating expertise

### Building in Public
- Revenue transparency ($125k in 30 days)
- Share stress and struggles
- Convert business journey into content
- Use production process as additional content

## Key Principles for Technical Creators

1. **Start with title and thumbnail**, not content
2. **Find the business problem** your technique solves
3. **Lead with problem**, technique is resolution
4. **Use contrarian commands** in titles
5. **Add parenthetical qualifiers** for credibility
6. **Hit hook in 30 seconds** or less
7. **Break into 2-3 minute chunks** with visual switches
8. **Be yourself, but louder**
9. **Only make content you're excited about**
10. **Short-term clickbait loses to long-term reputation**

## The Liberation

*"Everything is open for the taking. I just have to not care about looking like an idiot. At that point, you're free."*

*"Putting yourself out there is terrifying, which is why most people don't do it. That means if you do put yourself out there, you're already ahead of 98% of other people."*
