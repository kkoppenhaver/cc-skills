# YouTube Producer

Transform vague video ideas into compelling, viral-ready YouTube content using proven frameworks from top technical creators Mark Rober and Aaron Francis.

## Core Production Philosophy

### The Two Essential Frameworks

**Mark Rober's "Hiding the Vegetables"**: Make education so entertaining that viewers don't realize they're learning. Lead with spectacle, education follows naturally.

**Aaron Francis's "Nugget + Packaging"**: Every video has an educational nugget (the technical concept) wrapped in compelling packaging (the relatable problem/story) that makes it clickable without being misleading.

## Core Workflow

When a user provides a video idea, follow this production pipeline:

### 1. Identify the Nugget and Find the Packaging

**First, extract the educational nugget** - What technical concept or skill will viewers learn?

**Then, find the compelling packaging** by asking:
- What problem does this solve?
- What frustration does this address?  
- What curiosity does this satisfy?
- What justice does this deliver?

Example transformations:
| Educational Nugget | Compelling Packaging |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Virtual columns in MySQL | "Stop freeloaders exploiting your SaaS" |
| Database indexing | "Why your app is slow (and how to fix it)" |
| AI transformer architecture | "How ChatGPT learned to lie" |

### 2. Title Generation Using Proven Formulas

Apply these high-performing patterns:

**Contrarian Commands (Aaron Francis):**
- "Stop using [common practice]"
- "You don't need [assumed requirement]"  
- "[Common belief] is a lie"
- Add parenthetical qualifiers for credibility: "(anymore)", "(for shipping)", "(or sooner)"

**Superlative Hooks (Mark Rober):**
- "World's [Largest/Smallest/First] [Thing]"
- Promises something viewers have never seen before

**Question Format:**
- "Can [AI/You] Really [Seemingly Impossible Thing]?"
- "What Happens When [Unexpected Scenario]?"
- Poses questions viewers didn't know they had

**Justice/Problem-Solving:**
- "I Used [Technology] to [Solve Annoying Problem]"
- "How [Technology] Caught [Bad Actor]"
- Engineering as superpower for satisfaction

**Permission-Giving:**
- "You Don't Always Need [Complex Thing]"
- Liberates viewers from dreaded complexity

### 3. The 30-Second Hook Structure

Combine both creators' approaches:

**0-3 seconds (Visual Validation):**
- Immediately show visual proof of title's promise
- Most impressive moment or result
- No introductions, straight to spectacle

**3-10 seconds (Establish Stakes/Problem):**
- Surface problem viewers didn't know they had
- Create "curiosity loop" that needs closing
- Frame uncertainty: "We're not sure if this will work..."

**10-20 seconds (Identity & Credibility):**
- "If you're a [target audience]..."
- Brief credibility marker
- Why they should trust you

**20-30 seconds (Promise & Roadmap):**
- Clear promise of what they'll gain
- Preview the journey (not the answer)
- Pattern interrupt: "But first..." or "However..."

### 4. Video Structure (The Three-Act Journey)

**Act 1: Hook & Personal Stakes (0-2 minutes)**
- Open with spectacle or problem
- Establish personal connection/frustration
- Character introduction (name your subjects/tools)
- Set expectations without revealing outcome

**Act 2: The Journey (60-70% of video)**
- Document process including failures (Super Mario Effect)
- Chunk into 2-3 minute segments with visual variety
- Alternate high-energy reveals with educational explanations
- Show iterations and problem-solving
- Weave education naturally into narrative
- Include "breathing room" after complex concepts

**Act 3: Climactic Payoff (Final 20%)**
- Deliver the big reveal
- Perspective shift (frustration to admiration)
- Broader implications/lessons
- Circle back to opening question
- Single, clear call-to-action

### 5. YouTube Shorts Extraction

For each main video, identify 3-5 short moments:

**The Hook Short (15-30s):**
- Most shocking moment without context
- Title: Question the main video answers

**The Correction Short (30-45s):**
- "Stop doing [common practice]"
- Quick explanation of why it's wrong
- Tease full solution in main video

**The Permission Short (30-45s):**
- "You don't need [complex thing]"
- Show simpler alternative
- Link to full explanation

**The Justice/Result Short (15-30s):**
- Show the satisfying payoff
- Package thief getting glittered
- AI catching the scammer

## Thumbnail Design Principles

### Mark Rober's 3-Element Rule
- Subject (the build/experiment) - dominates frame
- Creator (relatively small) - 57% happy/confident expression
- Context/scale reference - shows magnitude

### Aaron Francis's Clean Technical Style
- Clean code/terminal screenshots
- Minimal text overlay
- Professional without desperation
- Tool logos when relevant

### Title-Thumbnail Synergy
- Thumbnail poses visual riddle
- Title completes the thought
- Together create "intensified curiosity"
- Never duplicate information

## Production Philosophy

### Quality Over Quantity
- Mark Rober: ~10 videos/year, some taking 3+ years
- Aaron Francis: Only content you're genuinely excited about
- Focus: "For something to be remarkable, it has to be able to be remarked about"

### The "Try Hard" Differentiator
- High production value signals content value
- The "1000 little things" compound into quality perception
- Clean setup, hidden desktop icons, good lighting
- Be yourself, but amplified 2 notches for camera energy

### Character-Driven Technical Content
- Name your AI models like Mark names squirrels
- Document failures as part of the journey
- Make viewers co-explorers, not students
- Show personality and vulnerability

## Retention Optimization Techniques

### Visual Variety (The Chunk Method)
- Switch between talking head and screen every 2-3 minutes
- Creates natural engagement checkpoints
- Prevents visual fatigue
- Maintains "dopamine pumping"

### Open Loops & Pattern Interrupts
- Promise multiple payoffs throughout
- "But there's a problem..." moments
- Tease coolest part early
- Use "However," "Yet," "But" for transitions
- Never reveal answer immediately

### The Super Mario Effect
- Focus on the goal (princess), not failures (pits)
- Show failures as learning, not embarrassment
- Make content feel like playing, not testing
- Results in 2.5x more persistence, 68% higher success

## Creator Framework Selection

Use specific creator approaches based on content type:

**Mark Rober Style** for:
- Large builds and experiments
- Visual spectacle content
- Family-friendly education
- Justice/satisfaction narratives
- See `references/mark-rober-framework.md`

**Aaron Francis Style** for:
- Developer/technical education
- Database and backend topics
- Controversial technical opinions
- Business problem solving
- See `references/aaron-francis-framework.md`

## Algorithm Alignment Without Obsession

### Do This:
- Clickable titles with genuine value
- 30-second hook or lose viewers
- Visual variety for retention
- Consistent publishing schedule

### Don't Do This:
- Misleading clickbait
- Shocked face thumbnails
- Content you don't care about
- Cynicism or excessive sarcasm

Remember Aaron's warning: "You can produce videos that do super well that you hate, and your insides will be hollowed out."

## Key Principles for Technical Content

1. **Start with title and thumbnail**, not the content
2. **Lead with problem or spectacle**, not the solution
3. **Make viewers co-explorers**, not students
4. **Document the journey**, including failures
5. **Hide vegetables** - education wrapped in entertainment
6. **Character-driven narratives** - name your tools/models
7. **Visual variety** - chunk into 2-3 minute segments
8. **Quality over quantity** - remarkable content only
9. **Be authentically excited** about your topics
10. **Build trust** through consistency and honesty
